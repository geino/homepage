homepage
========
My Firefox homepage //Also compatible with Chrome, Chromium, Safari [I think] and Midori.

Download the zip at - http://a.pomf.se/shigmi.zip
Extract the zip and put the folder anywhere you want.

It utilises simple Javascript to rotate the displayed Japanese banner depending on the time of day
e.g. in the morning it displays "oh hayo".
If you don't like Japanese I've included English banners as well that read "Good morning", "Good afternoon" etc.
Go to the preferences of your browser and set the homepage to wherever "konbanwa.html" is located.

A screenshot of the intended result can be seen here - http://a.pomf.se/nitliy.png

If you need any help with setting up, or if something is broken feel free to email me - tomhackshaw@mail.ru
Thanks!
